# Overview

The goal is to setup a deployable search utility to [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).

## Running locally

To simulate a test bed for our environment, start by running [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) with a [containerized setup](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker).

## Creating Custom Fields

We should do this manually - per https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1224.
